## Why use gRPC?

`gRPC` has a number of benefits for this project:

- Evolution of interfaces means that features can be added for particular calls added, without the need for numeric versioning.
- `gRPC` supports bidirectional streams. This is hugely beneficial for commands that produce incremental output of an indeterminate length. For example, this is heavily used in streaming video or logs from iOS.
- `gRPC` provides flexibility in the implementation of the server/companion. This may allow us to migrate `idb`'s companion server to a Swift implementation away from a Objective-C++ one without affecting the client's implementation.
